This program was written over 8 years old when I was just starting to program.. it's a horrible abomination. Everything is in a couple files. Please don't learn anything from this old project.

# LanParty
Chat client and game launcher designed for simplifying LAN parties. Written in Visual Basic 6.

(Games not included, this is just a test collection of mine)

The LanParty Client is designed to be distributed with a pre-made database of games of your choosing, ensuring that each game is available on the end user's computer.

There is some basic encryption for each packet based on a hard-coded key, and each user will generate their own unique key for each new user they connect to.

The program uses UDP for discovery and communication.
