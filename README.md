The LanParty Client is designed to be distributed with a pre-made database of games of your choosing, ensuring that each game is available on the end user's computer.

There is some basic encryption for each packet based on a hard-coded key, and each user will generate their own unique key for each new user they connect to.

The program uses UDP for discovery and communication.
